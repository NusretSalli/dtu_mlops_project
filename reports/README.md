# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

```--- question 1 fill here ---```

Where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is
auto-generated at the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image
to the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

```markdown
![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)
```

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

Will generate a `.html` page of your report. After the deadline for answering this template, we will auto-scrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate a `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final hand-in.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

Will check your answers in this template against the constraints listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, or have you included an image when asked. For both functions to work you mustn't rename anything.
The script has two dependencies that can be installed with

```bash
pip install typer markdown
```

## Overall project checklist

The checklist is *exhaustive* which means that it includes everything that you could do on the project included in the
curriculum in this course. Therefore, we do not expect at all that you have checked all boxes at the end of the project.
The parenthesis at the end indicates what module the bullet point is related to. Please be honest in your answers, we
will check the repositories and the code to verify your answers.

>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:

> *package to do ... and ... in our project*.
>
> Answer:

The project we have decided to work with is do determine whether or not a patient has melanoma skin cancer by analyzing an image. Since this is related to the patients health, the output of our model should be good but also be able to provide information on why it determined the class to be something specific. In order to do this the framework called "captum" have been used to be able to use several different explainability tool (LIME, IG, SHAP, etc.) to get an understanding on how the model behaves. Captum also fits our stack quite well, since a restnet from pytorch have been used, which allows us for seamlessly integration since they are in the same tech eco-system. 

## Coding environment

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment. This includes
> how you managed dependencies, the structure of your code and how you managed code quality.

### Question 4

> **Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go**
> **through to get an exact copy of your environment.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a*
> *complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands*
>
> Answer:

Managing dependencies can be quite difficult without proper setup - therefore the group have opted on using tasks.py and the invoke package to automate some of the tedious processes. We have several requirement files to keep track on our packages - for instance we have the requirement_dev.txt which is packages used solely during development (such as invoke), while requirements.txt is for the application to work. We have several invoke commands to automatically create an environment for you by using the createenvironment command - afterwards the requirements command can be used to download all packages in requirements.txt and with these two simple steps you have all the packages needed to run the "application"! The same steps can be taken to download the dev-tools. When updating the packages the tool called pipreqs have been used to automatically update the requirement.txt file throughout the development process.

### Question 5

> **We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your**
> **code. What did you fill out? Did you deviate from the template in some way?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder*
> *because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our*
> *experiments.*
>
> Answer:

We have used generally speaking not changed any of the structure from the cookiecuter template presented in the course. However, we did add several new files and folders to solve our specific problem. We have added several files such as data_statistics.py and train_gcp.py to get an overview of our data as well as separated training the model via cloud using vertex AI, respectively. Fruthermore, an api_default_data folder have been added for the user to make inference on selected "birthmark" images in case the user have no images themselves to test the model with in our application.
Otherwise most of the folders have been filled out such as tests, configs, dockerfiles, models, several requirement files, etc. 

### Question 6

> **Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? What about typing and documentation? Additionally,**
> **explain with your own words why these concepts matters in larger projects.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for linting and ... for formatting. We also used ... for typing and ... for documentation. These*
> *concepts are important in larger projects because ... . For example, typing ...*
>
> Answer:

It was clear that working with several people can lead to inconsistent declaration of variables, classes, etc. and therefore a "guideline" was needed. We opted for the PEP-8 guideline, which was also presented during the course to make the code easy to read and understand. However, sometimes formating can be hard uphold when coding and therefore invoke commands have been used again to make sure formatting is being implemented everywhere - this has been done by using the ruff package and mypy in our linting-command to easily format the code.

These concepts matter a lot in larger projects due to the fact that larger projects generally speaking have large amount of code and "interaction" between code. If formatting and "styling" isn't in place, then the code can become very difficult to read and understand, which makes it harder for people to debug or contribute (in open source projects).

## Version control

> In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
> corporate and increase the quality of your code.

### Question 7

> **How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *In total we have implemented X tests. Primarily we are testing ... and ... as these the most critical parts of our*
> *application but also ... .*
>
> Answer:

Several aspects of the codebase have been tested - we are currently testing both the model and data, as these are the most important part of our project. Specifically we check whether the model have been loaded correctly and whether the data have the correct shape and if they were loaded correctly.

### Question 8

> **What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If your code had a code coverage of 100% (or close**
> **to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our **
> *code and even if we were then...*
>
> Answer:

Even if the code coverage is 100%, then that doesn't mean that the code is error free. If we get 0 error, then that is solely because the tests that have been created is good, but there might be bugs or errors that we haven't considered testing (for instance edge cases or obscure circumstances) which won't be registered.

### Question 9

> **Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and**
> **pull request can help improve version control.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in*
> *addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...*
>
> Answer:

Both branches and pull requests have been used during our development. Working directly in the master branch is very dangerous as changes "can" result in bugs and errors which halts the process (have to revert to a previous commit). To circumvent this problem, branches can be used - when a certain feature wants to be implemented, a new branch can be made that essentially will contain the implemented feature. When satisfied a pull request can be created and the group members can look at the changes made (and what files it affects). This is very neat, since CI can be implmeneted using github actions where the merge can also only happen if all the tests have been correctlly completed. 

### Question 10

> **Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version**
> **control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.**
>

### Question 11

> **Discuss you continuous integration setup. What kind of continuous integration are you running (unittesting,**
> **linting, etc.)? Do you test multiple operating systems, Python  version etc. Do you make use of caching? Feel free**
> **to insert a link to one of your GitHub actions workflow.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 200-300 words.
>
> Example:
> *We have organized our continuous integration into 3 separate files: one for doing ..., one for running ... testing*
> *and one for running ... . In particular for our ..., we used ... .An example of a triggered workflow can be seen*
> *here: <weblink>*
>
> Answer:

As mentioned previously, Github Actions is used to implement continuous integration. We test multiple operating system (OS) to make sure that the codebase is OS agnostic. Formatting is also being run, to make sure that all code is being formatted correctly before being integrated to main.

## Running code and tracking experiments

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about the experimental setup for running your code and
> especially the reproducibility of your experiments.

### Question 12

> **How did you configure experiments? Did you make use of config files? Explain with coding examples of how you would**
> **run a experiment.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used a simple argparser, that worked in the following way: Python  my_script.py --lr 1e-3 --batch_size 25*
>
> Answer:

At first hydra was being thought of the way to run the experiments, but we went away from that and instead opted for weights and biases as our platform to document our experiments. The project have been shared with all group members which also make it easy to see who ran what and with what configuration. These result are then stored in our weights and biases.

### Question 13

> **Reproducibility of experiments are important. Related to the last question, how did you secure that no information**

### Question 15

> **Docker is an important tool for creating containerized applications. Explain how you used docker in your**
> **experiments/project? Include how you would run your docker images and include a link to one of your docker files.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.

>
> Answer:

We have created several docker files during the project: One for training using vertex AI, and two for deployment of our backend and frontend. You can readily build them and after being built, you can simply run them using the 'docker run' command: Link to the training docker where the other files also reside: <dockerfiles/train.dockerfile>

### Question 16

> **When running into bugs while trying to run your experiments, how did you perform debugging? Additionally, did you**
> **try to profile your code or do you think it is already perfect?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *Debugging method was dependent on group member. Some just used ... and others used ... . We did a single profiling*
> *run of our main code at some point that showed ...*
>
> Answer:

Members have different way of debugging the code. However one thing that all did was to put a few print statements to get a clear understanding of the behaviour of the code. Another approach that people also used is VSC's debugging panel, that works wonderfully. However this was mainly used when the error message was unclear and therefore difficult to understand what type of error the code outputted.

## Working in the cloud

> In the following section we would like to know more about your experience when developing in the cloud.

### Question 17

> **List all the GCP services that you made use of in your project and shortly explain what each service does?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the following two services: Engine and Bucket. Engine is used for... and Bucket is used for...*
>
> Answer:

Several Services have been used to make this project work: 

- Data storage (bucket): A project bucket has been created that will contain all the data and models that is being used to run the application. This makes it easy to have a centralized storage where we can freely add or retrieve data from.
- Vertex AI: This is a platform to build and deploy models in a simpler manner. We have used it to train our restnet on the data which reside in the bucket.
- Cloud run:

### Question 18

> Answer:

--- question 18 fill here ---

### Question 19

> **Insert 1-2 images of your GCP bucket, such that we can see what data you have stored in it.**
> **You can take inspiration from [this figure](figures/bucket.png).**
>
> Answer:

![alt text](bucket1.png)

Looking specifically in best_mlops_bucket, which contain our data we see the following:

![alt text](best_mlops_bucket.png)

We see that we have several folders, some for the data (both raw and processed) and some for the models.



### Question 20

> **Upload 1-2 images of your GCP artifact registry, such that we can see the different docker images that you have**
> **stored. You can take inspiration from [this figure](figures/registry.png).**
>
> Answer:

An image that shows the docker foldes used in the project can be seen below:

![alt text](overall_docker_image.png)

Where the api-artifact is the docker image for our application while the other folder is for training - looking further into the api-artifact we have these:

![alt text](api_docker_image.png)

Where it is seen we have different verions of the backend and frontend

### Question 21

> **Upload 1-2 images of your GCP cloud build history, so we can see the history of the images that have been build in**
> **your project. You can take inspiration from [this figure](figures/build.png).**
>
> Answer:

![alt text](cloud_build_17jan.png)

It is clear that several builds have been run, some of them failing and some of them actually succeeding.

### Question 22

> **Did you manage to train your model in the cloud using either the Engine or Vertex AI? If yes, explain how you did**
> **it. If not, describe why.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We managed to train our model in the cloud using the Engine. We did this by ... . The reason we choose the Engine*
> *was because ...*
>
> Answer:

As mentioned previously, Vertex AI have been used to train the model - this has been done by using the train_gcp.py file which trains the model on cloud. Not only that in order to actually run the model a config file was created in the configs folder called config_vertexAI.yaml, that specifies which VM to use, which docker image to run, etc. This is very neat, since this enables us to train fast and efficiently over cloud, and thus won't limit the hardware we have in possession locally (we do note however that the credit depletes faster if high-end compute is being rented :D)

## Deployment

### Question 23

> **Did you manage to write an API for your model? If yes, explain how you did it and if you did anything special. If**
> **not, explain how you would do it.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We did manage to write an API for our model. We used FastAPI to do this. We did this by ... . We also added ...*
> *to the API to make it more ...*
>
> Answer:

We did manage to write an api for our model - This has been done by using FastAPI, where the model is loaded, the user add an image and afterwards an inference is performed with the predicted class as well as a plot of the attribution created by using captum (in this case Integrated Gradients). The backend then plots the result for the user to see - the user can then add another image if wanted where the process is repeated. 

### Question 24

> **Did you manage to deploy your API, either in locally or cloud? If not, describe why. If yes, describe how and**
> **preferably how you invoke your deployed service?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.

> Example:
> *For deployment we wrapped our model into application using ... . We first tried locally serving the model, which*
> *worked. Afterwards we deployed it in the cloud, using ... . To invoke the service an user would call*
> *`curl -X POST -F "file=@file.json"<weburl>`*
>
> Answer:

As mentioned previously, a backend was created using FastAPI. However, we did accompany the backend with a frontend using streamlit to better create a good looking application, which works as intended locally - specifically in order to run the application locally, the backend needs to be activated and afterwards the streamlit command needs to be run by using the streamlit run function.
